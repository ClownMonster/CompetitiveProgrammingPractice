Constraints => 

1. Time Limit -> 1s, 2s, 3s and 4s sometimes rarely 100s.
2. Memory Limit -> mostly 256mb
 
3. Input Range (**imp)  

## analysis of input Range

1. maximum operations in 1sec is 10^8.
2. if range is 10^8 think of order n i,e O(n) solution
3. if higher thank 10^8 think of O(log n) or constant O(1) solutions
4. if 10^7 O(n log n).
